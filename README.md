The purpose of the study is to test three hypotheses:

User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.
Research progress

You will receive data on user behavior from the yandex_music_project.csv file. Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, before testing hypotheses, a review of the data is required.

You will check the data for errors and assess their impact on the study. Then, during the pre-processing phase, you will look for opportunities to correct the most critical data errors.

Thus, the study will take place in three stages:

Data review.
Data preprocessing.
Hypothesis testing.
